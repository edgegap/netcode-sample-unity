# Netcode for Game Objects on Arbitrium

This guide will help you create a headless server on Edgegap for a Unity project using [Netcode for GameObjects](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects) as its networking solution.

In this guide, we will be using the open-source sample project `2DSpaceShooter` from [Unity bitesize samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/) as an example.

This guide was written using `Unity 2021.3.8f1 LTS` on `Windows` to produce all Unity builds. Docker part was made using `Linux Mint Cinnamon 20.3`.
